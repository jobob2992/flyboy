flyboy
======

This is a 3d game made with zenilib ( http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bazald/l/ )

In this game you have a jetpack and teleport gun, inspired by the translocator from Unreal Tournament.
The goal of the game is to collect all of the gold pieces without being killed by the flying enemies which chase you.
